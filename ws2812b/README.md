# ws2812b

A directory that contains all code relating to my experiments with the WS2812B LED "NeoPixel" Adafruit light strips.


What is `neopixel`? 

From [NeoPixel Uber Guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide): _Not all addressable LEDs are NeoPixels. “NeoPixel” is Adafruit’s brand for individually-addressable RGB color pixels and strips based on the WS2812, WS2811 and SK6812 LED/drivers, using a single-wire control protocol._
