# NodeMCU Notes 

Node: A node in a network.  
MCU: Micro Controller Unit.  

From wikipedia: _NodeMCU is a low-cost open source IoT platform. It initially included firmware which runs on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC from Espressif Systems, and hardware which was based on the ESP-12 module._


I have an ESP8266 board which combined with firmware creates the [NodeMCU platform](https://www.nodemcu.com/index_en.html).  

What's the difference between ESP8266 and ESP32? https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-vs-esp8266/
